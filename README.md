A flexible and user-friendly custom event calendar built with React.

## Problems Solved

This project addresses the need for a customizable and intuitive event calendar that goes beyond the limitations of standard calendar applications. It provides a robust solution for:

* **Visualizing Events:** Displaying events clearly and efficiently on a calendar interface.
* **Managing Events:** Adding, editing, and deleting events with ease.
* **Customization:** Tailoring the calendar's appearance and functionality to specific needs.
* **Conflict Detection:** Identifying and resolving scheduling conflicts.
* **Recurring Events:** Handling events that repeat on a regular basis.

## Use Cases

This calendar application is suitable for a wide range of scenarios, including:

* **Personal Scheduling:** Managing appointments, deadlines, and personal events.
* **Team Collaboration:** Coordinating schedules and meetings for teams and organizations.
* **Project Management:** Visualizing project timelines and milestones.
* **Event Planning:** Organizing events, conferences, and workshops.
* **Resource Booking:** Scheduling the use of shared resources, such as meeting rooms or equipment.

## Challenges Faced

Developing this calendar application involved overcoming several technical challenges:

* **Complex Date Logic:** Accurately handling date calculations, including leap years and different time zones.
* **User Interface Design:** Creating an intuitive and user-friendly calendar interface.
* **State Management:** Efficiently managing the calendar's state, including events, date ranges, and user interactions.
* **Event Persistence:** Storing and retrieving event data (e.g., using local storage or a database).
* **Recurring Event Implementation:** Implementing the logic for handling complex recurring event patterns.
* **Conflict Detection Algorithms:** Developing efficient algorithms to detect and resolve event conflicts.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
* **Date Handling:** date-fns library
* **Styling:** Styled Components (though not explicitly listed in your provided "Technologies Used", it's used in your code, so I've added it for completeness as it's a key library for your styling)
* **Drag-and-Drop:** React DnD (often used for drag-and-drop functionality in React, assuming it's used based on your `DayCell.jsx` code)
* **Testing:** @testing-library/reactÂ
